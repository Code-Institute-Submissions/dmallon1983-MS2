<h1 align="center">Your Best 11</h1>

[Link to Project Page]()

This is my submission for MS2 in the Code Institute Full Stack Developer diploma. This website is for a football dream team 11, allowing the user to read up about legends of the game before submitting a list of players, selected via dropdown, through emailJS. This website was built with using the 'mobile first' principle and is fully responsive across all devices.

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs

1. Installing Bootstrap 5.0.0 issues
    - After installing Bootstrap 5.0.0. any anchor tags inherited a text-decoration border. All anchor tags containing text had to be targeted and the text-decroation set to none.
2. Input Form on Contact Page
    - The relative positioning of the Input form as causing responsive design issues so code adjusted to position table as a min-width with all round equal padding.
    - The text area col value was causing issues when moving to smaller screens. I had to override the textarea column value with a max-width value in the CSS file to make the textarea responsive
3. Footer Social Media links
    - I could not get these to behave in the Grid system as the 4th link would overflow onto the line below. I removed the letter spacing from the text which solved this issue.

4. X-axis Overflow on all pages
    - There was a horizontal overflow on all pages at first release. Issue corrected by switching the x-overflow to hidden.


#### Known Bugs

1. Firefox Desktop and Mobile Browser
    - The font family and weight seem to fall over on Firefox desktop and mobile.
